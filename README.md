# Simple Timesheet
## by Kevin Yang
#### Simple timesheet app build with ReactJS and Django 1.8

###### If you want to run this on your machine, create a virtualenv (virtual enviroment) before running. Included are two shell scripts for Windows and Unix/Linux to creat a virtualenv and install dependencies.

### Concept
The front-end should have the ability to add a new entry and display existing entries in table format with the ability to edit and delete.
A timesheet entry will have a date, two time inputs (from & to) and a simple text input for a comment.
